"""
Tests for BlockchainService's real contract-calling methods.

These exercise the actual (non-mocked) service logic - only the low-level
web3 contract instance is mocked - to verify BlockchainService calls
functions that actually exist on CreditScoreV2/LoanContractV2 with
correctly-shaped arguments, and that transaction records are written to
the database successfully (guarding against regressions like the
previously-missing `self.db` assignment, which made every real call crash
with AttributeError).
